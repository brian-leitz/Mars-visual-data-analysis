# Mars-visual-data-analysis
Using Jupyter Notebook, Beautiful Soup, Splinter and Python to scrape data and information from the Mars News Website.

Mars Website Link - static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html

This project involved using beatiful soup to extract text elements including title and preview text from the news articles on the Mars news website. We then scrape weather data from the website to analyze the provided weather data including the id of each transmission from the Curiosity Rover, the data on earth of the entry/transmission, the number of elapsed sols, also know as Martian days, since Curiosity landed on Mars, the solar longitude, the martian month, the minimum temperature and the atmospheric pressure at Curiosity location. I also calculated and analyzed the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months, as well as the average minimum daily temperature and plotted the results as a bar chart. 


## How this project can be useful

This project allowed me to work and continue developing core data analysis skills like collecting data via web scraping HTML elements and tables, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and visually communicating my insights.
